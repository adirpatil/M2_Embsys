# **Smart Home Automation**

## Introduction:   
Smart Home automation is a project which basically automates the basic home appliances according to the ease of user.
The main motive of this project is to ease the work of user and automate the tasks based on the surrounding environment
and time of the day.
In this project the two home systems of a fan and a light bulb are automated based on the room temperature and based on 
the intensity of the light present in the room.

## Objectives:
1. To automate the light bulb based on the intensity of the surrounding light.
2. To automate the speed of the fan based on the room temperature.

## Benefits:
It makes the users work easy by automating the tasks as he/she doesn't need to manually do these tasks.
Also the power can be saved when the appliances are kept powered on un-necessarily.
This is also cost as well as energy efficient.

## High Level Requirements:
|RID|DESCRIPTION|
|:--|:----------|:-----|
|HLR1|To turn on the light when the room light intensity is under Specific level|
|HLR2|To change the speed of fan based on the temperature|

## Low Level Requirements:
|RID|DESCRIPTION|
|:--|:----------|:-----|
|LLR1|To turn of the bulb when the resistance of LDR increases the light will be turned on|
|LLR2|To control the speed of DC motor with respect to the temperature variatons from the temperature sensor|
