# **Smart Home Automation**

## Introduction:   
Smart Home automation is a project which basically automates the basic home appliances according to the ease of user.
The main motive of this project is to ease the work of user and automate the tasks based on the surrounding environment
and time of the day.
In this project the home systems of a AirCon is automated based on the room temperature and displayed on a LCD display.

## Objectives:
1. To display the temperature on the LCD display.
2. To automate the AirCon based on the room temperature.

## Benefits:
It makes the users work easy by automating the tasks as he/she doesn't need to manually do these tasks.
Also the power can be saved when the appliances are kept powered on un-necessarily.
This is also cost as well as energy efficient.
